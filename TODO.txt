Important things todo:

Enable three.js antialiasing 

AI - Joey

Body accuracy(enemy bodies and the warp gate sensor need to be updated to match their models, which may require making enemy.runAI() do nothing for a bit so you can tweek the enemy objects without them trying to run away from you)-

add upgrades - 

balance crystals available, # of enemies, upgrades price -

soft boundary (remove hard walls and gently push items back into game area) - 

create radar/mini map -

Make asteroid resources more random (some drop no resources, some more) - 

shaders and fancy stuff (flashing lights for explosions, etc) -

Mik
