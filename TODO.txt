Important things todo:

AI - Joey

list destroyer (finished - needs testing) - Scott
create menu to load new level - Scott

Add warp gate model with sensor to call function for next level -Joey (I should get this done later this morning)

Body accuracy(enemy bodies and the warp gate sensor need to be updated to match their models, which may require making enemy.runAI() do nothing for a bit so you can tweek the enemy objects without them trying to run away from you)-

home station sensor that opens purchase menu (there is a check for if you are on the sensor, just needs a global boolean value added to it and needs to be tied into pause code I think?)-

purchase menu with things to buy (guns, upgrades, etc) - 
	Strafe upgrade is done - to enable/disable you set playerShip.strafeEnabled to true or false

Add max speed to player ship -
	see comment in updatePlayer function in game.js, use playerShip.maxSpeed property

Add player death when health reaches 0 - 
	see comment in updatePlayer function in game.js
	(already checked for in prototyping, just need to write a 	playerDeath() function that is called when player dies, 	the call is commented out for now but is in the Player 	object in prototyping.js)

create radar/mini map - 

Make asteroid resources more random (some drop no resources, some more) -
